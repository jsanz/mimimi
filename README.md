# Mimimify

> A website to convert pedantic quotes into something more mundane

This is just a silly site created to test how [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) plays with React, TypeScript, and Sass. The site is created using the `react-ts` template and then adding [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) for a minimalistic responsive styling.

If you want to run this site locally just take a look at the `package.json` file for the details.
